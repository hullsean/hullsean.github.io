Years ago I was working at a customer for a few weeks.  There was some confusion as to what was going on, in terms of progress.  Things weren't moving as quickly as they expected.

After a lot of back and forth, I suggested I could provide detailed notes of what I had done.

<p><p>
After I put together my in-depth notes the customer was really happy.  It seems these notes had highlighted a few problems that they didn't know about.  What's more they even highlighted some people issues, where communicate was blocked.  Whats more the notes underlined what I was doing, and this really improved the customers confidence in the work product.

<h2>1. Visibility</h2>

Keeping daily notes is a habit I found useful over and over again.  If your client or customer comes to you and says, why are we paying $X, you can provide the notes as a detailed explanation of what they have gotten for their money.

<h2>2. Transparency</h2>

Transparency is a door that swings both ways.  As I mentioned above it can be great when the customer is not sure how much work was done, or what the bill is for.  But it can also highlight things they may not want done.  For instance perhaps you were investigating a problem authenticating to a server.  You determined that it was an important piece.  

When the customer sees this in your notes they may say "Oh we don't need to deal with that system.  Please leave it alone" or they may say "We actually have Rakesh available to help us with that piece, so please communicate with him and he can resolve that".

<h2>3. Trust</h2>

Most important of all, keeping detailed notes helps build trust.  Many customers, hiring managers & CTOs are not command-line technical.  And that's perfectly normal.  However looking over a long list of notes like these provides great insight to them as to what you do from day-to-day.  

Do they need to know what every line means?  No.  But the visibility goes a long long way toward building trust in the consultant client relationship.
